                <h3>Agentic AI Penetration Testing Framework</h3>
                <p>Evolving a proof-of-concept into a full-fledged, agent-based penetration testing framework driven by AI. The system coordinates multiple agents to automate reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation workflows, and mitigates hallucinations by validating commands and using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It supports session memory for continuity, runs repeated tests inside a controlled lab environment, and generates structured post-exploitation reports â€” all to boost automation, accuracy, and usability in AI-assisted penetration testing.</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Clone the repo locally in VS code, Open the folder in VS Code, Run .\setup.ps1 (Windows) or ./setup.sh (macOS/Linux) in the terminal. Note you need Python 3.11 or 3.12.</p>

                <h3>Secure File Encryption Application (Group Project)</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a desktop application enabling file encryption/decryption using AES-256 with a user-friendly graphical interface.</p>
                <p>Developed account management features, including password recovery and client-server authentication via RSA digital signatures to ensure secure user access.</p>
                <p>Built a challenge-response authentication system to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and safeguard remote communications.</p>
                <p>Implemented storage separation by user email to enhance file confidentiality and account-level data isolation.</p>
                <p>Delivered a lightweight, intuitive alternative to existing encryption tools, balancing strong security protocols with usability for non-technical users.</p>

                <h3>Player Dodge Game</h3>
                <p>This is a game where you have to avoid all of the obstacles that are thrown at you like fireballs, cars, rockets, and cannons for 30 rounds. There are 10 different types of obstacles including 5 different fireball colors, 2 different car and rocket sizes, and cannons with lots of animation and colors. Built with Python using the CMU CS Academy website module.</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Avoid the obstacles by pressing the arrow keys to move the player. You can also collect the snowflakes on the screen to gain points for each round. The player will have to survive for 30 rounds or gain 30 points to win the game.</p>
